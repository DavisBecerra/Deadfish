Deadfish is about as oddball as they get.
It was created by Jonathan Todd Skinner
and originally programmed in C, but has
been since ported to over 50 other
programming languages, including
additional esolangs. It takes no input
and only outputs integer values.

The kicker with Deadfish is its commands,
which naturally include an xkcd -comics-
variation.

Deadfish has only four commands: o for
output accumulator, s for square the
accumulator, d for decrement the
accumulator and i for increment the
accumulator.
